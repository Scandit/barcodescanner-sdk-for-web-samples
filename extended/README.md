# Running the extended sample

## License key
Replace `"-- ENTER YOUR SCANDIT LICENSE KEY HERE --"` with your license key. If you don't have a license key yet,
you can sign up for a trial [here](https://ssl.scandit.com/customers/new?p=test&source=websdk).

## Development server
You can use you own tools, or follow the instructions below to quickly set up a local development server.

We suggest using the `live-server` tool, which can be installed from npm.

```
> npm install -g live-server
```

`live-server` can be run easily to serve the sample and make it easy to preview changes.

```
> live-server
```
